First Class Functions

-> Functions are trated as first class citizens
-> Functions are simply values
->Functions are just another type of object

-> Store functions in variable or properties
->Pass functions as arguments or other Functions
->Return Functions from Functions
->Call methods on functions

First class functions is just a concept that JS has!

Higher order functions 
-> A function that receives another function as arg., that returns a new function, or both
->This is only possible because of first order funfctions.


If there are 2 or more objects in a code, then how the "this" keyword can be used?

There are three methods
call, bind and apply


Call Method-
const variableName = functionName.call(objName,List of functionParameters);

apply Method-
functionName.apply(objName,Array of functionParameters);

Bind Method- (Important)

const NewfunctionName = functionName.bind(ObjName);
NewfunctionName call(list of parameters);
